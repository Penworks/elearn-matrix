	Blogging is like writing a book, a little every day. And as with all books, each one is very <em>different</em>. We can think of it like this: Is it fiction, a diary, a guide, a travelogue, poetry, science, arts, music, whatever. So, like with books, the title will say alot (or what needs to be hinted at) about the content.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Some blogs are <strong><em>syndicated content</em></strong> from other blogs - just like the Reuters newsstreams of old, they work in the same way, to share and disseminate the content to as wide an audience as possible. Some blogs share very specific niche content, with downloads or other sharable files, sometimes only shared temporarily, like music blogs.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Video blogging</strong> is also a really popular and effective way of making your blog engaging and &#39;added value&#39;. A lot of people prefer to consume content via video rather than reading articles, so it might be a way to gain more audicne, or appeal to a younger crowd.</p>

	This is a simple exercise which requires little intervention from the teacher but can help to encourage members of &nbsp;a group to work together and link what they do online to the face to face element of your course.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Steps</strong>:<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px;">
	1. &nbsp; Identify a range of useful weblinks related to aspects of a topic which you are currently covering in your module.<br />
	2. &nbsp;Give each group 2 or 3 links - you may already have groups set up on your module (if not, see the attachment below &#39;How to set up Groups in Weblearn&#39;)<br />
	3. &nbsp;Ask each group to evaluate each of the links for reliability as a source, and to synthesise the key information from the links.<br />
	4. &nbsp;Use a Blog or Discussion Forum and ask each group to post a summary of what they&#39;ve found.<br />
	5. &nbsp;Next time you meet in a face to face situation, have each group informally present a summary of what they&#39;ve found from their set of web links. This could lead into a more general discussion.<br />

	Most educators would not willingly want to teach in a classroom where the furniture was badly laid out, the purpose of the class wasn&#39;t clear and there was rubbish all over the desks and chairs. Yet it&#39;s not uncommon to find online learning environments with links that don&#39;t work, content areas that are empty or full of irrelevant and outdated material and learning content and activities which have no clear instructions or purpose.<br />
	<br />
	The content below is designed to help Weblearn users understand how to present content, make sure links are up to date and Hide any content or tools which are not being used in the module.<br />
	<br />
	The panel below contains links to guides and short videos to give you some ideas.</p>

	<big>If you&rsquo;ve ever taken part in online <strong>discussion forums</strong>,&nbsp; you&rsquo;ll know that they can be frustrating. It&rsquo;s quite common for participation to be low, or for a discussion to be dominated by one or two participants, with nobody else contributing very much.</big></p>
<p>
	<big>Of course, you can never guarantee that all students on a module will contribute fully and meaningfully&nbsp; to a discussion forum, but there are certain steps you can take which make it more likely that the discussions generated will be worthwhile.<br />
	<br />
	To start with, take a look at the short video from the University of New South Wales which gives an overview of <strong>moderating discussions</strong>. They have also created a useful PDF guide which you can download from the link below.<br />
	<br />
	Finally, take a look at some of the <strong>practical suggestions</strong> in the panel below the video.</big></p>

	It&rsquo;s easy to think that by uploading a lot of content to Weblearn, students will automatically be able to find that content and know what to do with it. Although certain content may not require much explanation or interaction, it&rsquo;s usually a good idea to provide a context for any learning content you upload or create, so that students know exactly where to find it, what to do with it and what is expected of them &ndash; this can help to create a more effective and positive learning environment.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	There&#39;s a good introduction to the concept of scaffolding learning content from Faculty Focus which you can read on the link below:<br />

	The latest version of Blackboard has some improved communication tools which allow you and your students to create and sustain <em>dialogue</em>. However, it can be difficult to know which of these tools (if any) is suitable for your purpose, as certain tools probably lend themselves better to certain types of task.<br />
	<br />
	For example, if you&rsquo;re looking for an online space where a student can reflect on their learning and share their thoughts, and prefer to keep this inside Weblearn, an online J<strong>ournal </strong>is probably the best option. On the other hand, if you want students to communicate and, for example, comment on each others&rsquo; ideas, then a <strong>Discussion Forum </strong>or <strong>Group Blog</strong> might be a better choice.<br />
	<br />
	This learning resource will give an overview of these tools and help you decide which is the one you need.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	For a quick overview of these communication tools, have a look at the attached guide <strong>&#39;Getting Started with Interactive Tools</strong>&#39; from Blackboard.</p>

	<b>Google Drive</b> is an increibly versatile addition to any teaching situation, whether it&#39;s primary school age, or higher education. Teachers benefit because they can share teaching materials, they are easily commented on or otherwsie notated. They also have <em>&#39;versioning</em>&#39; (more on that article #2), they can be updated without having to reshare, and more. Students can also benefit hugely, not only becaise of all of the above, but also they can work with each other - in group work - using Google Docs Drive for document creating, sharing, or other file sharing.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Google Drive</em></strong> gives you</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		5gb of space online</li>
	<li>
		You can store anything, but only some file types can be edited online</li>
	<li>
		Whoever you share anything with needs to have their own Google account</li>
	<li>
		Google Drive lets you have multiple isntances of your files, on multiple devices. As long as they are connected to the internet, they will synch automatically</li>
</ul>

	The<strong> </strong>Entry point&nbsp;&nbsp;to a Weblearn module is simply the first page that students see when they enter that module - it&#39;s the equivalent of a Home Page.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s a good idea to think about your module from your students&rsquo; perspective. Try asking yourself the following questions when thinking about the Entry Point to any module you are creating or working on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Is the name and ID of the module immediately clear?</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Are there contact details for key staff involved in the module?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Is there any information on how to access important content on the module?</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Will the page be static or dynamic (in other words do you want to periodically change and update it with new information)?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Is the page uncluttered and visually appealing? (it&rsquo;s not always easy to make Weblearn look nice, but at the very least the information on the Entry page should be clear and easy to read)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	See the panel content below for different ways to set up your Entry Point. There&#39;s also a short video from Golden West College which might give you a few ideas.</p>

	<strong>Prezi is marvellous</strong>. Students love to use Prezi, and staff, once they get the hang of it, think it&#39;s fab.&nbsp; In fact, as a soft skill toteach all students, it ranks very highly indeed. And staff too, all need to learn how to use prezi, becasue their lectures will benefit from much more engaging presentations, as well as the added bonuses of embedded YouTube (or uploaded video getting a player automatically), great fonts, beautful themes, and most of all, being able to view your lecture slides online, easily.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We can embed Prezi with just a few copy and paste bits of code into Weblearn too, so that makes it doubly useful. before you get worried about privacy and protecting your content, you can share a Prezi to just your chosen audeince, no one esle, so no need to worry. Having said that, the more you share your material, the more you might get interesting and useful feedback, as well as an anhanced reputation!</p>
